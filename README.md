# Sudoku Solver

A program that can attempt to solve any sudoku board supplied.

This is a rewrite of my python project and is intended to help strengthen 
my C programming skills as well as backtracking as a process.

# To compile:
1. `gcc sudoku.c -o Sudoku`

# To Run:
`./Sudoku <input file> <output file name>`
