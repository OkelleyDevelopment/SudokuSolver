# Sudoku Solver

## Motivation
To build a program that can attempt to solve any sudoku board specified 
by the user using a backtracking algorithm and then write the output
to a specified file. 

This is an implementation of my original python project 
and has helped strengthen my C programming skills 
as well as further reinforcing the process of setting up a backtracking
algorithm.

## Program Execution
1. Clone this repo by running this command in the terminal
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/OkelleyDevelopment/SudokuSolver.git

2. Compile by running the command

    ```

3. Run the program by typing this command
